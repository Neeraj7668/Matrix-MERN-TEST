REACT:-

1. create refs in function component by using React.createRef()
2. Show example for Class component and Functional component?
3. Show example to read value from params in route URL?
   for Example <route path=’/posts/:id’ component={ABCPOST}/> read id from this
4. Into function component example and use hooks.(useState,UseEffect,UseCallback)

5. Show an example of form using react form with basic "required" validation

6. Also show an example for useContext hook

Note: Actually, I haven't used Context API. I'm using Redux Thunk or Redux-Saga for state management.
